The Ypsilanti Math Corps at the University of Michigan is a summer program for middle and high school students from the Ypsilanti area. Based on the model of the 27-years-running Wayne State Math Corps, we focus on more than math skills: we prioritize mentorship through a kids-teaching-kids model, providing a positive learning environment, and a strong sense of family. In 2019, our first year, the Ypsilanti Math Corps saw student test score averages triple after just four weeks! This improvement shows that these students are capable of incredible achievement given the right opportunities.

Last summer the Ypsilanti Math Corps hosted 40 middle schoolers and 20 high schoolers. Given the studentsâ€™ successes, we are looking for community partners to help increase the number of students we are able to host by 50% next summer, as well as to keep the Math Corps running on a long-term basis.
